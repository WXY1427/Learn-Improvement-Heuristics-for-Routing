Yaoxin Wu, Wen Song, Zhiguang Cao, Jie Zhang and Andrew Lim. Learning Improvement Heuristics for Solving Routing Problems, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2021 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9393606).

## Description

A deep reinforcement learning framework to learn the improvement heuristics （with pairwise local operators, e.g. 2-opt, swap, reinsertion） for routing problems.

## Running the program

For each problem and size:

### Training

```
python3 run.py
```
or run jupyter file
```
RUN MY MODEL.ipynb
```

### Testing

```
python3 test.py
```
or run jupyter file
```
Test with model.ipynb
```
